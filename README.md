🌎 EnviroTrack Pro — Refinery Environmental Compliance Platform
Live Demo: https://envirotrack-pro.vercel.app/
Repository: https://github.com/Emmanuel-igbokwe/envirotrackPro
EnviroTrack Pro is a fully integrated environmental compliance dashboard built for petroleum refineries.
It unifies 12 critical regulatory programs into one modern, real‑time platform — replacing the scattered spreadsheets and outdated tools typically used in industry.
This project demonstrates advanced React engineering combined with deep environmental domain expertise across CAA, CWA, RCRA, SPCC, EPCRA, OPA 90, and RMP/PSM programs.

🚀 Features and Capabilities
🔧 Multi‑Program Compliance Coverage
EnviroTrack Pro includes fully interactive modules for:

LDAR (Leak Detection and Repair)
GHG Reporting (40 CFR Part 98)
BWON (Benzene Waste Operations NESHAP)
RCRA Hazardous Waste
SPCC / AST Inventory
NPDES / WWTP Effluent Monitoring
RMP / PSM
Flare Events & Stack Testing
CEMS Live Monitoring
Corrective Action Tracking
Incident Management (NOVs, deviations, spills)
Training Certifications & Matrix
Permit Management

Each module includes KPIs, compliance status indicators, regulatory citations, and graphical displays.
